**Abstract**: 
This study investigates the impact of mining activity on deforestation in Sub-Saharan Africa between 2001 and 2018. Using data on the extraction of 14 minerals and deforestation across diverse regions, we apply Two-Way Fixed Effects Difference-in-Differences (TWFE-DID) methods to uncover the persistent and wide-reaching effects of mining, including prospecting activities, on forest loss. Our findings provide robust evidence that mining significantly contributes to deforestation across multiple spatial levels, including buffer zones, cells, and districts. Notably, indirect impacts surpass direct ones, with deforestation extending up to 80 km from mining sites. These results remain consistent through extensive robustness checks, accounting for fluctuations in global mineral prices. Employing causal mediation analysis, we identify key mechanisms driving deforestation, including local economic activity, agriculture, urbanization, conflict, and infrastructure development. Additionally, our study reveals nuanced variations in deforestation impacts based on mine size, mineral type, ownership structure, mining method, and regional intensity.

**Abstract**
This study integrates spatial and georeferenced data on the discovery and mining of 32 minerals with information on power and energy access (measured by population density and night lights) across various spatial resolutions (1x1 km and 55x55 km) in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) from 2000 to 2022. By leveraging exogenous variations in discovery years and global prices for 14 minerals, we identify a significant positive impact of mining on developing power infrastructure and local energy access. We further explore the effects of mining on electricity access, utilizing household and cohort data from Demographic and Health Surveys. Through recent event study designs, we identify the influence of mining activities on energy access. The study also examines heterogeneous effects, such as the size of mines, types of minerals, and ownership. Findings indicate that regions mining energy-intensive minerals like uranium and cobalt have the lowest energy access rates.
In contrast, areas producing less energy-intensive minerals, such as gold and other precious metals, show significantly higher rates. Additionally, mining operations in SSA exhibit enclave characteristics, as evidenced by significant positive spillover effects on neighboring mining cells. In addition, energy access is more significant in mining areas closer to large cities, ports, energy infrastructures, and large agricultural areas.

The New Mining Rush: Mineral Discoveries and Social Conflicts in Africa

**Abstract**
The global energy transition, while essential, imposes considerable social and political costs, particularly in mineral-rich countries that supply critical resources. This paper examines the relationship between mining discoveries and conflict incidence in Africa from 1997 to 2022, leveraging high-resolution data at the 55x55 km grid-cell level. Using the timing of mining discoveries as an exogenous shock, our analysis reveals a significant rise in conflict during the exploration phases, particularly in the Pre-Feasibility and Feasibility stages, prior to mine operations. Notably, these conflicts—primarily social, including riots and protests, as well as conflicts over gold minerals—diminish in significance once mines become operational, as evidenced by Two-Way Fixed Effects Difference-in-Differences (TWFE-DID) estimations.
The findings highlight substantial heterogeneity in conflict patterns based on mine size, mineral type, and ownership structure. Furthermore, through a mediation analysis, we identify key mechanisms that amplify or mitigate the effects of mining discoveries on conflict, emphasizing the role of public administration engagement in local communities. Our results remain robust under alternative specifications, including using mineral prices and various TWFE methodologies as treatment variables.
