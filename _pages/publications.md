**Abstract**: 
This study examines the impact of mining on deforestation in Sub-Saharan Africa (2001â€“2018). Using geospatial data on 14 minerals and a Two-Way Fixed Effects Difference-in-Differences (TWFE-DID) approach, we find that mining significantly increases deforestation, with indirect effects exceeding direct ones and extending up to 80 km from mining sites. Causal mediation analysis identifies key mechanisms, including agriculture, urbanization, infrastructure, and conflict. Results remain robust to global mineral price fluctuations and vary by mine size, mineral type, and ownership structure. Our findings highlight the broad environmental footprint of mining and the need for sustainable policies.

**Abstract**
This study uses spatial data and measurements of population density and night lights to examine the impact of mining 32 minerals on power and energy access in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) from 2000 to 2022. By analyzing variations in mineral discovery years and global prices for 14 minerals, we find that mining significantly improves power infrastructure and local energy access. We investigate the effects of mining on electricity access using data from Demographic and Health Surveys and recent event study designs. Our results reveal that regions mining energy-intensive minerals like uranium and cobalt have the lowest energy access. In contrast, those mining less intensive minerals such as gold have higher access rates. Additionally, mining areas exhibit enclave characteristics, with positive spillover effects on nearby regions. Energy access is notably greater in mining locations near large cities, ports, and key agricultural areas.

# The New Mining Rush: Mineral Discoveries and Social Conflicts in Africa

**Abstract**
The global energy transition is crucial but presents social and political challenges, particularly in mineral-rich African countries. This study uses high-resolution data to explore the relationship between mining discoveries and conflict from 1997 to 2022. Utilizing a Two-Way Fixed Effects Difference-in-Differences (TWFE-DD) design, our findings indicate that conflict increases during exploration, primarily due to protests and riots over gold minerals. This escalation peaks during the Pre-Feasibility and Feasibility stages before continuing to rise after production starts. Conflict patterns vary by mine size, mineral type, and ownership. Mechanism analysis highlights local economic development (local economic activity, electricity access, urbanization, and migration) and environmental degradation (deforestation rate and natural disasters) induced by mining, amplifying the risk of conflict and emphasizing the need for local engagement. Results are consistent across varying specifications, including the use of mineral prices as a treatment variable and adopting a Synthetic Control Differences-in-Differences design.
