 This study examines the impact of mining on deforestation in Sub-Saharan Africa (2001–2018). Using geospatial data on 14 minerals and a Two-Way Fixed Effects Difference-in-Differences (TWFE-DID) approach, we find that mining significantly increases deforestation, with indirect effects exceeding direct ones and extending up to 80 km from mining sites. Causal mediation analysis identifies key mechanisms, including agriculture, urbanization, infrastructure, and conflict. Results remain robust to global mineral price fluctuations and vary by mine size, mineral type, and ownership structure. Our findings highlight the broad environmental footprint of mining and the need for sustainable policies.

# More than light: Energy and malaria in africa

Access to electricity poses a significant challenge, particularly in rural areas of Sub-Saharan Africa. This lack of access does not mitigate the morbidity and mortality associated with malaria. This study investigates the causal relationship between electricity access and the incidence of malaria in 25 Sub-Saharan countries, utilizing various sources of georeferenced data (DHS, Afrobarometer, Malaria Atlas, population, and night light) with different spatial levels (5km, DHS cluster, and child under 5 years). The findings indicate that people living in electrified areas are less likely to contract malaria. This study underscores the importance of electrification in Africa as a critical component in the fight against malaria, as it contributes to improving household income levels, improving access to preventive information, and improving overall living conditions.

This study investigates the effect of mining activities involving 32 minerals on energy access (created using population and night lights at 1x1 km of resolution) in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) from 2000 to 2022. Using georeferenced data in cells of 0.5°×0.5°, we compare energy access in areas with active mines to those with inactive mines, which are defined as sites that were discovered but were never active, serving as our control group. Our results indicate no evidence of active mines on energy access when using inactive mines for comparison. However, when all areas (without mines) are considered as the control group, the impact of mining activities appears significant and positive. Our findings show that regions mining energy-intensive minerals like uranium and cobalt have the lowest energy access. In contrast, those mining less intensive minerals such as gold have higher access rates. Interestingly, cells with Giant and SuperGiant mine sizes have relatively low energy access for local communities. We also investigate how mining affects electricity access using DHS data. Additionally, mining areas exhibit enclave characteristics, with positive spillover effects on nearby regions. Energy access is notably greater in mining locations near generators, power plants, large cities, ports, and key agricultural areas. Our results remain robust when considering the impact of mineral prices on energy access.

The global energy transition is crucial but presents social and political challenges, particularly in mineral-rich African countries. This study uses high-resolution data to explore the relationship between mining discoveries and conflict from 1997 to 2022. Using high-resolution remote sensing data combined with a dynamic panel and event-study approach, our findings indicate that conflict increases during exploration, primarily due to protests and riots over gold minerals. This escalation peaks during the Pre-Feasibility and Feasibility stages before continuing to rise after production starts. Conflict patterns vary by mine size, mineral type, and ownership. Mechanism analysis highlights local economic development (local economic activity, electricity access, urbanization, and migration) and environmental degradation (deforestation rate) induced by mining, amplifying the risk of conflict and emphasizing the need for local engagement. Results are consistent across varying specifications, including using mineral prices as a treatment variable and adopting a Synthetic Control Differences-in-Differences design.
