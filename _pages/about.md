I am pursuing a Ph.D. in Development Economics at [University of Poitiers](https://www.univ-poitiers.fr/) and the [EIEA Chair (ABS-UM6P and Mines ParisTech)](https://www.linkedin.com/company/eiea-um6p/). Additionally, I am an Associate Researcher at the [Energy and Prosperity Chair](http://www.chair-energy-prosperity.org/en/category/research-fellows-1/mboundor-diouf-en/). Currently, I work at the World Bank Group as a consultant in the Development Research Group [DECRG](https://www.worldbank.org/en/about/unit/unit-dec/research), focusing specifically on the ["Energy in Africa"](https://www.worldbank.org/en/about/unit/unit-dec/research/initiatives#7) Initiative.

During my thesis, I benefited from various training in economics, mining, energy, environmental economics, spatial econometrics, and GIS during my visit as a scholar to [ASU (6 months)](https://www.asu.edu/), [University of Coimbra (1 month)](https://www.uc.pt/en/), [Friedrich Schiller University Jena (7 days)](https://www.uni-jena.de/en), and [UM6P (1 year)](https://www.um6p.ma/), as well as short stays at [Columbia University (5 days)](https://www.columbia.edu/) and [University of Oxford (4 days)](https://www.ox.ac.uk/).

Previously, I graduated with a Bachelor's and Master's (Magister) grade at [UCA (CERDI)](https://cerdi.uca.fr/#/admin).

My research focuses on **Natural Resources** (*Mining*, *Oil*, and *Gas*), **Energy Access**, **Sustainable Development**, and **Development Economics** in **developing countries**.
My recent and future work centers on **Energy Access**, **Crucial Minerals for the Energy Transition**, **Sustainable Development**, and **Climate Change**.
