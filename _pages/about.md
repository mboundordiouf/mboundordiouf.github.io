I obtained my PhD in Economics from the [EIEA Chair (ABS-UM6P and Mines ParisTech)](https://www.linkedin.com/company/eiea-um6p/) and the [University of Poitiers](https://www.univ-poitiers.fr/). Recently, I worked at the World Bank Group as a consultant in the Development Research Group (DECRG), focusing specifically on the ["Energy in Africa"](https://www.worldbank.org/en/about/unit/unit-dec/research/initiatives#7) Initiative.

During my thesis, I benefited from various training in economics, mining, energy, environmental economics, spatial econometrics, and GIS during my visit as a scholar to ASU (6 months), University of Coimbra (1 month), Friedrich Schiller University Jena (7 days), and UM6P (1.5 years), as well as short stays at Columbia University (7 days) and University of Oxford (7 days).
