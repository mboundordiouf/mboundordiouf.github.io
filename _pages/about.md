Welcome to my personal page!

I am a Ph.D student in Development Economics at the [University of Poitiers](https://www.univ-poitiers.fr/) and [EIEA Chair (ABS-UM6P and Mines ParisTech)](https://www.cerna.minesparis.psl.eu/Recherche/EIEA/). I am affiliated with the [LÃ©P](https://lep.labo.univ-poitiers.fr/accueil/les-membres/diouf-mboundor/) and Associate Researcher at [Energy and Prosperity Chair](http://www.chair-energy-prosperity.org/en/category/research-fellows-1/mboundor-diouf-en/).

During my thesis, I benefited from different training in economics, mining, energy, spatial econometrics, and GIS during my visiting scholar to [ASU (6 months)](https://www.asu.edu/), [University of Coimbra (1 month)](https://www.uc.pt/en/), Jena University [Friedrich Schiller University Jena (7 days)](https://www.uni-jena.de/en), and [UM6P (1 year)](https://www.um6p.ma/) and short stays at [Columbia University (5 days)](https://www.columbia.edu/) and  [University of Oxford (4 days)](https://www.ox.ac.uk/).

Previously, I graduated with a Bachelor's and Master's (Magister) grade at [UCA (CERDI)](https://cerdi.uca.fr/#/admin).

My research focuses on **Natural Resources** (*Mining*, *Oil* and *Gas*), **Energy**, **Sustanaible Development** and **Developement Economics** in **Africa**. 
My recent and future work centers on crucial minerals for the green energy transition, such as nickel, rare earth, copper, cobalt mining, and energy access.
