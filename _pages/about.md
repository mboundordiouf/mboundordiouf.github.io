Welcome to my personal page!

I am a Ph.D student in Development Economics at the [University of Poitiers](https://www.univ-poitiers.fr/) and [EIEA Chair (Mines ParisTech and UM6P)](https://www.cerna.minesparis.psl.eu/Recherche/EIEA/). I am affiliated with the [LÃ©P](https://lep.labo.univ-poitiers.fr/accueil/les-membres/diouf-mboundor/) and Associate Researcher at [Energy and Prosperity Chair](http://www.chair-energy-prosperity.org/en/category/research-fellows-1/mboundor-diouf-en/).

Previously, I graduated with a Bachelor's and Master's (Magister) grade at [UCA (CERDI)](https://cerdi.uca.fr/#/admin).

My research are focusing on **Natural Resources** (*Mining*, *Oil* and *Gas*), **Energy**, **Sustanaible Development** and **Developement Economics** in **Africa**. 
My recent and future works center on crucial **green energy transition** minerals, such as nickel, rare earth, copper, and cobalt mining, and **energy access** in Africa.
